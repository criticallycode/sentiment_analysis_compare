# sentiment_analysis_compare
A comparison of sentiment analysis methods. This project compares the output of different methods of sentiment analysis. TextBlob's Sentiment Analysis Classifier, the VADER Sentiment Classifier, and a Custom Voting Classifier are compared here.

If you would like to see the comparison of all three sentiment analysis modules in action, there is an IPython Notebook attached to this repo.
